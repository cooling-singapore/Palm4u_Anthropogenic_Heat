# PALM4U-Anthropogenic-Heat

This repository is an extension of **PALM4U version 23.10**, designed to integrate external heat source profiles into PALM4U simulations. This development allows users to model the effects of anthropogenic heat emissions more accurately.

### Key Features

This version introduces the following functionalities to PALM4U:
- Users can define **anthropogenic heat profiles** in **NetCDF format**, following the structure outlined in [`PALM4U_AH_NetCDF_file_structure.txt`](./PALM4U_AH_NetCDF_file_structure.txt).
- These heat profiles are automatically applied to specific buildings and points within the modeling domain.

### Impact of External Heat Profiles (as of Oct. 2024)

Applying external heat profiles affects the heat fluxes within the modeling domain as follows:

1. **Override of Default Heat Emissions**  
   PALM4U’s default building energy model emissions are set to zero and replaced by the anthropogenic heat fluxes specified in the NetCDF file.

2. **Building-Specific Heat Emissions**  
   Anthropogenic heat emissions associated with building IDs are uniformly emitted from the building's roof surface. This simulates the heat effects of cooling towers typically located on rooftops.

3. **Point-Specific Heat Emissions**  
   Anthropogenic heat emissions linked to point IDs are released at the nearest ground-level grid cell. This setup simulates the effect of district cooling plants operating at ground level in the specified locations (as indicated by x and y coordinates in the NetCDF file).

### Purpose

As of Oct. 2024, this development primarily serves to link **PALM4U** with the **City Energy Analyst (CEA)**, an urban energy modeling software. The anthropogenic heat emission outputs generated by **CEA** in the **Cooling Singapore** project’s forked repository can be converted into the NetCDF inputs required by PALM4U. Although the Cooling Singapore project has ended, this functionality remains available for future users or projects that wish to simulate anthropogenic heat emissions in urban environments.
